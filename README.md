# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React's `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function might not be called if the component unmounts too quickly. This example uses console logs to highlight the issue.  The solution involves carefully examining the logic triggering component unmounts and possibly refactoring to prevent premature unmounts or using techniques to ensure cleanup function execution.

## Problem
The provided code attempts to log messages to the console during component mount and unmount.  However, under certain conditions (e.g., fast navigation or rapid state changes), the unmount message might not be logged, indicating that the cleanup function within `useEffect` hasn't been executed.

## Solution
The solution is to address the underlying cause of rapid unmounting or to implement more robust cleanup procedures.  The solution file offers potential strategies such as debouncing or throttling events to prevent overly frequent component updates that might lead to premature unmounts.
